# Pi Pico Motherboard Controller

This project turns a Raspberry Pi Pico into a custom PC power management controller, designed to interface a modern case with a proprietary motherboard and a 12VO power supply.

This controller solves several hardware compatibility issues:

- It generates the missing `PWR_OK` ("Power Good") signal required by the motherboard to boot safely.
- It intelligently controls the case fans via a 5V relay, adding a five-minute cooldown period after the PC shuts down.
- It reads the case's power and reset buttons and uses a second relay to operate the motherboard's power switch.
- It knows if the PC is on or off by directly sensing the 5V power from a motherboard USB port.
